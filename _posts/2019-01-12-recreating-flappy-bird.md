i’ve been testging out the godot engine, 
and to do that i’m recreating flappy bird in it. 
You can try it out here [triktron.com/flappy-bird/](http://triktron.com/flappy-bird/)

Current version suports the basic game and a temerary highscore system.

I need to improve the loading times and add a server to keep your highscores saved.
