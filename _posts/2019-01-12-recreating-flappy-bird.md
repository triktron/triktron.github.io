I've been testing out the Godot engine, 
and to do that I'm recreating flappy bird in it. 
You can try it out here [triktron.com/flappy-bird/](http://triktron.com/flappy-bird/)

Current version supports the basic game and a temporary high score system.

I need to improve the loading times and add a server to keep your high scores saved.
