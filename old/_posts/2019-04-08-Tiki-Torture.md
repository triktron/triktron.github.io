=====================================

the past few days I've been invited and participated in a game jam organized by students of my school.

things didn't go as we planned sadly...

for most people of my team it was the first time doing a jam, so we didn't really know what to expect.

and as a result the planning was a giant mess. but you learn from your mistakes.

for anyone reading this, here are a few tips if you partake on an adventure of yourself.

1. don't get too ambitious, keep it small.
2. do not, I repeat, do not bake lights if you don't know what you are doing.
3. try and balance your team, if you have 2 artists try and have 2 programmers too.
4. know what you and your team can and cannot. don't try to do it all yourself
5. and finally, remember to have fun, winning isn't the point, its learning.

we started out with too big of an idea. and in the end couldn't deliver.

it was still a lot of fun to do.

I wish I had recorded the results of the other teams, they were awesome.

if I ever find them again, ill share it again c:
